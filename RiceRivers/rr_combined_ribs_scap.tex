\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{frame}{Combining rib and scapula}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item I re-ran the random forest models using ribs and scapula samples combined.
    \item The models don't distinguish between ribs and scapula, so neither type
   is given more weight than the other.
    \item In general, we expect improved overall model performance due to the
    larger sample sizes obtained by combining ribs and scapulae samples.  This
    is particularly relevant for the models using swabs, since the sample sizes
    are smaller than for the bone data.
    \item However, if there are notable differences in the rib and scapula
    samples, this could adversely affect model fit and interpretation.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Choosing taxa to include}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In our previous separate analyses for ribs and scapulae, we have
    required that a taxon must have a prevalence of at least 1\%  in at least 2
    samples in order to be included in the analysis.
    \item When doing the analysis using combined rib and scapula samples, we
    require that the taxa must have met this standard for \textbf{both} ribs and
    scapulae to be included.  This means that the number of taxa considered in
    the model is smaller than the numbers used in the individual rib and scapula
    models.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Influential taxa are different}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The influential taxa are different for the analyses using ribs only,
    scapulae only, and combined ribs and scapulae.
    \item This is partly because, to be included in the combined rib/scapula
    model, a taxon must have a prevalence of at least 1\% in at least 2 rib
    samples \textbf{and} at least 2 swab samples.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The following influential taxa in the rib model were not included in
    the combined rib/scapula model:\\
    Haliangiaceae and Rhodospirillaceae
    \item The following influential taxa in the scapula model were not included
    in the combined rib/scapula model:\\
    Methylocystaceae and Tissierellaceae
    \end{itemize}
    \item The following taxa were in the "top 10" influential taxa for all
    three models:\\
    Enterobacteriaceae and Methylococcaceae
  \end{itemize}
