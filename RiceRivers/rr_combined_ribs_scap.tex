% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{frame}{Combining rib and scapula}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item I re-ran the random forest models using ribs and scapula samples combined.
    \item The models don't distinguish between ribs and scapula, so they are
    treated equivalently.
    \item In general, we expect improved overall model performance due to the
    larger sample size.  This is particularly relevant for the models using
    swabs, since the sample sizes are smaller than for the bone data.
    \item However, if there are notable differences in the rib and scapula
    samples, this could adversely affect model fit and interpretation.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Choosing taxa to include}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In our previous separate analyses for ribs and scapulae, we have
    required that a taxon has a prevalence of at least 1\%  for at least 2
    samples in order to be included in the analysis.
    \item When doing the analysis using combined rib and scapula samples, we
    require that the taxa must have met this standard for both ribs and scapulae to be
    included.  This means that the number of taxa considered in the model is
    smaller than the numbers used in the individual rib and scapula models.
  \end{itemize}
